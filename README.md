# USS-Protocol-8051-C-MICROMASTER420

USS Protocol using 8051 C

USS protocol for communication with Siemens MICROMASTER 420 driving unit using the AT89S8253 microcontroller (EASY8051A development board) as a control unit through which the frequency control of inverter is done and the parameters of the Siemens driving units are changed. The physical interface for communication between units is RS-485. The programming language for the implementation of the protocol is C.

The programming is done in Keil uVision 4 IDE.
